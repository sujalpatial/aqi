#  FUTURE MONITORING SYSTEM 

## Total Time: 5 minutes

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello! Today I'm presenting the Future Monitoring System - 
a next-generation air and water quality monitoring platform 
that uses Edge AI and IoT to predict pollution before it happens."

### Problem Statement (30 seconds)
"Current systems only measure pollution after it occurs. 
Our system PREDICTS it using AI, giving hours of advance warning."

### Live Demo (3 minutes)

#### Step 1: Show Dashboard (30 seconds)
"Here's our NASA-inspired dashboard. You can see:
- Real-time air and water quality indices
- Multiple sensor nodes on the map
- Current readings updating every 10 seconds"

#### Step 2: Trigger Anomaly (45 seconds)
*Run the anomaly simulator*
"Watch what happens when we simulate an industrial accident 
releasing high PM2.5. The system immediately:
1. Detects the anomaly with Edge AI
2. Turns the gauge red
3. Shows a critical alert
4. Sends an email notification"

#### Step 3: Show AI Prediction (45 seconds)
"Now let's look at our AI predictions. Based on current trends,
the system predicts AQI will rise to 180 in the next 3 hours.
It even provides health recommendations."

#### Step 4: Show Heatmap (30 seconds)
"The heatmap shows pollution concentration across the city.
Red areas need immediate attention, green areas are safe."

### Technical Architecture (30 seconds)
"Our system uses:
- ESP32 with TinyML for Edge AI
- MQTT for real-time communication
- React for the dashboard
- Machine learning for predictions"

### Impact & Future (30 seconds)
"This system can:
- Save lives through early warnings
- Help cities plan pollution control
- Be deployed globally
Future enhancements: More sensors, blockchain for data integrity, mobile app"

### Q&A Ready (30 seconds)
"Questions about the technology, implementation, or potential applications?"
